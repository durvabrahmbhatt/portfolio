## 🚨 Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find someone has copied my site without giving credit. I spent significant effort building and designing this iteration of my portfolio, and I am proud of it! All I ask is that you do not claim this work as your own.

Please note that I did not build this site as a starter theme. If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs).

If you like my work, give it a star⭐.

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give proper credit by linking back to [Durva.site](https://Durva.site/). Thanks!
